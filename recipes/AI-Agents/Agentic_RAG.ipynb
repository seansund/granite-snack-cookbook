    "# Build a LangChain agentic RAG system using the Granite-3-8B-Instruct model in watsonx.ai.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author**: Anna Gutowska\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will create a LangChain agentic RAG system using the IBM [Granite-3-8B-Instruct model](https://www.ibm.com/granite) now available on [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) that can answer complex queries about the 2024 US Open using external information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview of agentic RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "[RAG](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG) is a technique in [natural language processing (NLP)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing) that combines information retrieval and generative models to produce more accurate, relevant and contextually aware responses. In traditional language generation tasks, [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) such as Meta's [Llama Models](https://llama.meta.com/) or IBM’s [Granite Models](https://www.ibm.com/granite) are used to construct responses based on an input prompt. Common real-world use cases of these large language models are chatbots. When models are missing relevant information that is up to date in their knowledge base, RAG is a powerful tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are AI agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of agentic RAG systems are [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence) agents. An [AI agent](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents) refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and using available tools. Agentic technology implements tool use on the backend to obtain up-to-date information from various data sources, optimize workflow and create subtasks autonomously to solve complex tasks. These external tools can include external data sets, search engines, APIs and even other agents. Step-by-step, the agent reassesses its plan of action in real time and self-corrects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Agentic RAG versus traditional RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic RAG frameworks are powerful as they can encompass more than just one tool. In traditional RAG applications, the LLM is provided with a vector database to reference when forming its responses. In contrast, agentic RAG implementations are not restricted to document agents that only perform data retrieval. RAG agents can also have tools for tasks such as solving mathematical calculations, writing emails, performing data analysis and more. These tools can be supplemental to the agent's decision-making process. AI agents are context-aware in their multistep reasoning and can determine when to use appropriate tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents, or intelligent agents, can also work collaboratively in [multiagent systems](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/multiagent-system), which tend to outperform singular agents. This scalability and adaptability is what sets apart agentic RAG agents from traditional RAG pipelines. \n",

    "This recipe is also available on [IBM.com](https://www.ibm.com/think/tutorials/agentic-rag).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "You need an [IBM Cloud® account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) to create a [watsonx.ai™](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1. Set up your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can choose from several tools, this tutorial walks you through how to set up an IBM account to use a Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log in to [watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/registration/stepone?context=wx&apps=all) using your IBM Cloud account.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a [watsonx.ai project](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=projects-creating-project).\n",
    "\n",
    "\tYou can get your project ID from within your project. Click the **Manage** tab. Then, copy the project ID from the **Details** section of the **General** page. You need this ID for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=editor-creating-managing-notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "This step will open a Notebook environment where you can copy the code from this tutorial.  Alternatively, you can download this notebook to your local system and upload it to your watsonx.ai project as an asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2. Set up a watsonx.ai Runtime instance and API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a [watsonx.ai Runtime](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watsonxai-runtime) service instance (select your appropriate region and choose the Lite plan, which is a free instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate an application programming interface [(API) key](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-authentication.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Associate the watsonx.ai Runtime service instance to the project that you created in [watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/assoc-services.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3. Install and import relevant libraries and set up your credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll need a few libraries and modules for this tutorial. Make sure to import the following ones; if they're not installed, you can resolve this with a quick pip installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common Python frameworks for building agentic RAG systems include LangChain and LlamaIndex. In this tutorial, we will be using LangChain.  \n"

We experimented with various model parameters, including temperature, minimum and maximum new tokens and stop sequences. Learn more about model parameters and what they mean in the [watsonx docs](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas). It is important to set our `stop_sequences` here in order to limit agent hallucinations. This tells the agent to stop producing further output upon encountering particular substrings. In our case, we want the agent to end its response upon reaching an observation and to not hallucinate a human response. Hence, one of our stop_sequences is `'Human:'` and another is `Observation` to halt once a final response is produced.\n",

    "In this tutorial, you created a RAG agent using LangChain in python with watsonx. The LLM you worked with was the IBM Granite-3-8B-Instruct model. The sample output is important as it shows the significance of this [generative AI](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) advancement. The AI agent was successfully able to retrieve relevant information via the `get_IBM_US_Open_context` tool, update its memory with each interaction and output appropriate responses. It is also important to note the agent's ability to determine whether tool calling is appropriate for each specific task. When the agent had the information necessary to answer the input query, it did not use any tools for question answering. \n",
