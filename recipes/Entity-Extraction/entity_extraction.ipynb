    "<u>**Class Definition:**</u> We create a class that encapsulates all the relevant entities as members. Each member corresponds to an entity such as title, author, etc., and can include type annotations for better validation and clarity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Pydantic Integration:**</u> Utilizing Pydantic, a data validation library, we convert this class into a Pydantic model. This model not only defines the structure of our data but also provides built-in validation features, ensuring that any extracted data adheres to specified formats and types.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Dynamic Prompting:**</u> The Pydantic model can then be integrated with the prompt sent to the LLM. This allows for a more dynamic interaction where the model can adapt based on the defined structure of entities. If new entities are added or existing ones modified, changes can be made at the class level without needing to rewrite the entire prompt.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Enhanced Validation:**</u> By leveraging Pydantic's capabilities, we can ensure that any data extracted by the LLM meets our predefined criteria, enhancing data integrity and reliability.  \n",

    "This class-based approach offers greater flexibility and scalability compared to the first method. It allows for easier modifications and expansions as new requirements arise, making it particularly suitable for larger projects or those requiring frequent updates."
