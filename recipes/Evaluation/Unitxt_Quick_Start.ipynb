    "# Model Evaluation: Quick Start Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional software systems that rely on prescribed specifications and application code, AI systems based on machine learning models depend on training data to map inputs to outputs. Consequently, these systems are inherently non-deterministic and may produce errors due to variability in the training data or the probabilistic nature of the underlying algorithms. To evaluate such systems, benchmarks are commonly used to address user concerns, such as accuracy and bias. However, since benchmarks can be manipulated over time to achieve favorable results, it is essential to establish a flexible evaluation framework that supports rapid updates to evaluation criteria and benchmark selection. Given the critical role of testing and evaluation in deploying AI systems, there is a pressing need for a consistent methodology and robust tool support for these activities. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of generative AI, evaluation serves to provide evidence that fosters user trust in models and systems. Specifically, it involves measuring and quantifying how a model or system responds to inputs. Are the responses within acceptable bounds—free from hate speech, hallucinations, or other harmful outputs? Are they useful, cost-effective, and reliable?\n",

    "[Unitxt](https://www.unitxt.ai) is an innovative library for textual data preparation and evaluation of generative language models. It deconstructs the data preparation and evaluation flows into modular components, enabling easy customization and sharing between practitioners. Unitxt as an extensive [catalog](https://www.unitxt.ai/en/latest/catalog/catalog.__dir__.html) of datasets, tasks, templates, metrics and textual operators, that can be used as-is, or be combined in innovative ways to create new evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, lets evaluate Granite's performance on the [OpenbookQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/openbookqa) dataset from HuggingFace. We load the dataset using its card, generate the model client, run inference, and evaluate the results.\n",
