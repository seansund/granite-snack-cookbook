    "# Prompt Declaration Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is difficult: minor variations in prompts have large impacts on the output of LLMs and prompts are model-dependent. In recent years <i> prompt programming languages </i> have emerged to bring discipline to prompt engineering. Many of them are embedded in an imperative language such as Python or TypeScript, making it difficult for users to directly interact with prompts and multi-turn LLM interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Prompt Declaration Language (PDL)](https://ibm.github.io/prompt-declaration-language/) is a YAML-based declarative approach to prompt programming, where prompts are at the forefront. PDL facilitates model chaining and tool use, abstracting away the plumbing necessary for such compositions. It enables type checking of the input and output of models. PDL has been used with application patterns like RAG, CoT, ReAct, and an agent for solving SWE-bench. PDL is [open-source](https://github.com/IBM/prompt-declaration-language).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use PDL stand-alone or from a Python SDK. In a Jupyter notebook, a convenient extension lets you write PDL directly, without the need to write Python \"boilerplate\". It even provides color coding of the YAML declarations and in the cell output, model-generated text is rendered in green font, and tool-generated text is rendered in purple font. We will use this notebook extension here.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE:** Internally, PDL uses [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/) to connect to a variety of model providers. This is an alternative to the [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/) API we are using in other recipes. "

    "Specifically, we formulate a prompt for code explanation. The program first defines two variables: `code`, which holds the data we read from `./data.yaml`, and `truth` for the ground truth read from `./ground_truth.txt`. It then prints out the source code, formulates a prompt with the data, and calls a model to get an explanation. Finally, a Python code block uses the [Levenshtein text distance metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) to evaluate the explanation against the ground truth. This pipeline can similarly be applied to an entire data set to produce a jsonl file."
